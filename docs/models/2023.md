# MSDB 2023-12 snapshot

## MHC2 Binding Prediction Models

There are two models trained on the MSDB snapshot 2023-12. The MHC2 hit peptides from the following
file have been used:

`s3://biontech-de-sftp-bucket/msdb/2023-12/curation/filter_results/filtered_peptides_mhc2.dedup.2023_12_v1.csv`

Details of the deconvolution runs:

- Only the mono-allelic data have been used, covering 83 alpha/beta allele pairs.
- Only peptides from the `train` partition (`train_0`, ..., `train_4`) have been used.
- Per-allele deconvolution was performed with 1 to 3 classes and 20 EM runs per combination.

After that, a single motif has been selected for each allele by visual inspection of the plots.

This results in the following models:
