# MSDB 2020 snapshot

## MHC2 Binding Prediction Models

There are four models trained on the **merged `train` and `tune`** partition of the BNT US
mono-allelic snapshot from 2020 that covers 84 alleles.

The train, tune and test file that have been used so far for training the BioNDeep models do not
contain all hits from the MSDB. Instead, nested sets have been computed based on sequence overlap,
and only one representative of each nested set is retained (chosen at random among the
minimal-length peptides of each nested set). Since EMMo has its own mechanism of dealing with shared
sequences (downweighting peptides that are overlapping with others, as also done in MoDec), models
were also obtained using the full set of MHC2 ligands in the train and tune partition.

This results in the following models:
